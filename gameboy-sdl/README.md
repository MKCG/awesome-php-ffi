This example uses the sameboy library for Game Boy emulation + SDL2 library for rendering.

You'll need to compile the [sameboy library](https://github.com/LIJI32/SameBoy) and change the `FFI_LIB` on `sameboy_libretro.h` file.

You'll need to install the [SDL2 library](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) and change the `FFI_LIB` on `sdl.h` file.
